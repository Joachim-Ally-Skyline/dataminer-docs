### Enhancements

#### Service & Resource Management: Booking name validation now case-insensitive [ID_38556]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU1] - FR 10.4.4 -->

The validation of the name of a booking is now case-insensitive. This means that when the SRM Framework checks if there are future bookings with the same name, the casing is now no longer taken into account.

### Fixes

#### Problem with file offload mechanism when main database is offline [ID_38542]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU12] / 10.4.0 [CU1] - FR 10.4.4 -->

When the main database is offline, file offloads are used to store write/delete operations. In some cases, this file offload mechanism could end up in an unrecoverable state due to a threading issue.

#### SLAnalytics - Pattern matching: A match of one subpattern would incorrectly be considered a match of the entire multivariate pattern [ID_38587]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU1] - FR 10.4.3 -->

When the streaming method was being used, a match detected for one subpattern of a multivariate pattern would incorrectly be considered a match of that entire multivariate pattern.

Although the suggestion events were generated correctly, the pattern matches would not be indicated correctly on the trend graphs.

#### SLAnalytics - Automatic incident tracking: Problem when updating alarm groups [ID_38629]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU13] / 10.4.0 [CU1] - FR 10.4.4 -->

Each time the focus score of an alarm is updated, incident tracking has to update its alarm groups. In some cases, incident tracking would incorrectly update its groups twice, causing the groups to be set to an undefined state.
